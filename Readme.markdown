# WWMD: What Would Myles Do?

With an hour to spare at [OSDC08](http://osdc.com.au/) we combined Myles' lack of attendance with our memory of his best rants and created [whatwouldmylesdo.com](http://whatwouldmylesdo.com/): a single-serving implementation of [Myles Byrne](http://github.com/quackingduck/)'s brain.

The `master` branch contains this readme and the myles isms. This gets `git fetch`'d on the server every few minutes to update the website with any new mylesisms. 

The `www` branch contains the sinatra app.

## Contributing isms

Simply request to be a collaborator to the [official github repo](http://github.com/toolmantim/wwmd) and then use github's web interface to edit the `m-isms.txt` file.

## Developing

Run `rackup development.ru` and fire up `http://localhost:9292/`

## See the launch
